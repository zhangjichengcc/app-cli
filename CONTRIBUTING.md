## Contributing workflow

<!-- - After deciding which [GitHub issue](https://github.com/fabien-ml/hope-ui/labels/help%20wanted) or feature you'd like to work on, create a local branch to track your changes
- If applicable, add unit tests while implementing your code
- Ensure that all commits follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- It is highly recommended that you run the `pnpm test` command to ensure new contributions integrate with the old codebase before initiating a merge request
- Create a merge request and keep up-to-date with any feedback you receive from a maintainer -->

## Git branches

<!-- - **main**: the current version
- **develop**: contains the next version under development (you should create a PR to this branch) -->
